# Project restructure and cmake - Tutorial 23

In this tutorial I cover the restructure I’ve done to the git repository and the implementation of a more cross platform build system. If you already have a build process and structure for your engine that you prefer you can stick with that and don’t feel the need to re-organize things to match what I have exactly.
